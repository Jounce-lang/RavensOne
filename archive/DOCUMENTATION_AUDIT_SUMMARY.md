- 3jnc markdown files → 4 in root
- Easy to understand project structure

### 3. Preserved History
- All historical documents in `docs/archived/`
- Nothing permanently deleted
- Can reference past decisions

### 4. Scalable Structure
- Easy to add new guides
- API specs grouped together
- Architecture docs centralized

### 5. Better Discoverability
- New contributors find guides easily
- API documentation centralized
- Clear separation of concerns

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Update Internal Links
Some documents may have links to files that moved. Update references:
- `README.md` → Update links to moved docs
- `PROJECT_TRACKING.md` → Update file paths
- Other docs → Check for broken links

### 2. Create docs/README.md
Add a documentation index:
```markdown
# RavensOne Documentation Index

## Getting Started
- [Quick Start Guide](guides/QUICKSTART.md)
- [Compiler Guide](guides/COMPILER-GUIDE.md)

## API Reference
- [Registry API](api/REGISTRY_API_SPEC.md)
- [Package Manifest](api/PACKAGE_MANIFEST_SPEC.md)

## Architecture
- [Standard Library Design](architecture/STDLIB_DESIGN.md)
- [Reactivity Implementation](architecture/REACTIVITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

## Archived
Historical documents preserved in [archived/](archived/)
```

### 3. Consider .github/
Move some docs to `.github/` for GitHub integration:
- Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Create `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Create issue/PR templates

### 4. Add Navigation
Update README.md with documentation navigation:
```markdown
## Documentation
- [Quick Start](docs/guides/QUICKSTART.md)
- [API Reference](docs/api/)
- [Architecture](docs/architecture/)
- [Full Documentation Index](docs/)
```
